## ⚡ Super Fast: Use Placeholder

If you need to launch NOW:

1. Copy `/public/blog/placeholder.svg` 8 times
2. Rename to each image name
3. Replace with real images later

This will work but won't be optimized for each post.

## ✅ After Generating Images

1. **Verify dimensions:** All should be 1200x630px
2. **Compress:** Use TinyPNG.com (target <200KB each)
3. **Upload:** Place in `/public/blog/` directory
4. **Test:** Run `npm run dev` and visit `/blog`
5. **Check social sharing:**
   - [Twitter Card Validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator)
   - [Facebook Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/)
