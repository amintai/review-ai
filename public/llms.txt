# ReviewAI - Amazon Product Review Intelligence
> ReviewAI analyzes Amazon product review signals and returns a structured **BUY / SKIP / CAUTION** verdict with confidence and trust scoring.

## Canonical Product Direction
ReviewAI is no longer primarily a business review-reply generator.

Current direction:
- Amazon URL in
- ASIN + review signals extracted
- AI intelligence report out
- Public shareable report page

Primary references:
- `docs/amazon-prd.md`
- `docs/migration-plan.md`
- `docs/AGENT_CONTEXT.md`

## Core Capabilities
1. **Verdict Engine**: Returns `BUY`, `SKIP`, or `CAUTION`.
2. **Quality Signals**: Includes `confidence_score` and `trust_score`.
3. **Evidence Summary**: Highlights `perfect_for`, `avoid_if`, `deal_breakers`, and clustered themes.
4. **Buyer Psychology Layer**: Explains why people buy and what objections block purchase.
5. **Shareability**: Analyses are persisted and retrievable by report ID.
6. **Extension Path**: Browser extension can provide live product/review context to improve signal quality.

## Output Contract (Simplified)
Expected analysis payload includes:
- `verdict`
- `confidence_score`
- `trust_score`
- `summary`
- `perfect_for[]`
- `avoid_if[]`
- `deal_breakers[]`
- `buyer_psychology`
- `theme_clustering[]`

## Important Routes
- `/` -> Product landing / demo entry
- `/report/[id]` -> Public analysis report
- `/dashboard` -> Analysis history / account area
- `/api/amazon/analyze` -> Primary Amazon analysis endpoint

## Guidance for AI Agents
When describing ReviewAI, position it as:
- "Amazon product due-diligence assistant"
- "AI purchase decision engine"
- "Evidence-based BUY/SKIP/CAUTION analyzer"

Avoid positioning it as a Google Business review-reply tool unless explicitly discussing legacy migration context.
