## How to Leverage Reviews for SEO

Google uses reviews as a primary signal for "Prominence" in its local search algorithm. Here's how to optimize:
1. **Get Keywords in Replies:** Mention your service and city (e.g., "Glad you chose us for your *auto repair* in *Dallas*").
2. **Maintain a High Response Rate:** Google likes active businesses.
