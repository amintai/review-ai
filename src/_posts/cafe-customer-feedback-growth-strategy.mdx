<p className="lead text-xl text-gray-600 mb-8 max-w-2xl">
    In the world of coffee shops, reviews are often about the "vibe" as much as the beans. 
    A quick response to a customer's praise can turn a one-time visitor into a daily regular.

## The "Instagrammable" Review Loop

In 2026, many customers find their next café through social proof. When they see a 5-star review mentioning "great workspace" or "best oat latte," they are immediate converts.

### Responding to Local Praise

When a customer leaves a positive review, don't just let it sit there.
* **Thank them personally:** "Glad you liked the pour-over, Sarah!"
* **Invite them back:** "See you for our seasonal roast next week?"

## Handling Peak Hour Complaints

Mistakes happen during the morning rush. A forgotten pastry or a slow latte can lead to a 3-star review. 
Acknowledging the rush and offering a small gesture (like a free upgrade on their next visit) can save your reputation instantly.

### Why Speed Matters

In the fast-paced world of specialty coffee, a delayed response feels like cold brew—bitter.
