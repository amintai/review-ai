    Why do some businesses always show up in the "Top 3" on Google Maps while others are buried on page two? The answer often lies in their engagement level.

## The "Prominence" Signal
Google uses three main factors for local ranking: **Relevance, Distance, and Prominence.**

Prominence is based on how well-known a business is. Google explicitly states that "The score and number of reviews are factored into local search ranking." But it's also about **engagement.**

### Freshness and Frequency
A business that responds to a review from 2 days ago is signaled as "active" and "well-managed." This signal of activity helps push you higher in the Map Pack.

## Keyword Injection: The Proper Way
When you respond to a review, you have an opportunity to naturally include keywords that customers search for.
- **Incorrect:** "Thanks for the review. We are the best plumber in Austin Texas for emergency drain cleaning." (Spammy)
- **Correct:** "We're so glad we could help with your *emergency drain cleaning*! We take pride in being a reliable *Austin plumber*." (Natural)
