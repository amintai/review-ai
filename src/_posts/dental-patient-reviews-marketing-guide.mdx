    Patients don't just pick the closest dentist anymore; they pick the one with the best stories. 
    In the healthcare world, online reviews are the new "word of mouth."
</p>

## The "Trust Factor" in Dentistry

Searching for a dentist is an emotional journey as much as a medical one. Patients are often nervous and look for reviews that mention "painless," "friendly," or "explained everything."

### HIPAA and Review Responses

A common fear among dentists is violating patient privacy when replying to reviews. 
The rule is simple: **Never confirm medical details.** Even if the patient mentions a root canal, your reply should stay general.
Learn more on our [Dentist Reputation Management](/for-dentists) page.

## Encouraging Feedback Post-Visit

The best time to ask for a review is right after a successful appointment. 
1. **SMS Requests:** High open rates.
2. **QR Codes:** Place them at the reception desk.
3. **Follow-up Emails:** Send a "How did we do?" note the next day.

## Automating the Professional Voice

Medical reviews require a high level of professionalism. ReviewAI helps dental offices maintain a calm, empathetic, and expert tone across all platforms.
