    For any local business, your Google Business Profile (GBP) is your digital storefront. But one wrong move with review management can lead to profile suspension.

## Understanding Google's Core Values

Google's review system exists to provide **authentic, unbiased feedback** for users. Any attempt to manipulate these reviews is local SEO suicide.

### Prohibited & Restricted Content
1. **Spam and Fake Content:** Reviews should reflect real experiences at the business location. Providing "incentivized" reviews (offering a free coffee for a 5-star rating) is strictly against [Google's policies](https://support.google.com/contributionpolicy/answer/7400114).
2. **Conflict of Interest:** You cannot review your own business, and employees shouldn't review their employer.
3. **Off-topic Reviews:** Reviews must be about the business experience, not social or political commentary.

## Why "Compliant" Automation Matters

Many business owners try to use "auto-reply" bots that post the same generic text to every review. Google's algorithms can detect this patterns, often flagging it as low-quality engagement.

### The ReviewAI Approach
We built [ReviewAI](/?utm_source=blog_policies&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=google_policies) to be "human-first." Our AI suggests a draft based on the specific context of the review, but **you maintain final approval.** This ensures your engagement remains authentic and compliant.

## Facing a Negative Review?
Don't panic. A negative review that follows policy is a permanent part of your profile unless you can prove it's fake. The best response is a professional, empathetic reply that shows potential customers you care.
