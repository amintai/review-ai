    For a restaurant, a single bad review can be the difference between a busy Friday night and an empty dining room.

## Why Reviews Matter for Diners

When someone searches for "best pasta near me," Google doesn't just look at your menu—it looks at your stars. Restaurants with a rating of 4.5+ get **3x more clicks** than those with a 4.0.
